# DDS
DDS is German and stands for Dreh-Dr√ºcksteller (rotary and push knob). In this project an Arduino and Bluetooth is added to an original DDS and coupled to an Android hello world application, to enable mock-up in-vehicle interfaces on Android for experiments.

**myDDS** is the Arduino sketch.<br/>
**helloDDS** a hello world example for Android, that shows the recieved commands. 

We have seen several times, that simulators were equipped with rotary knobs without haptic feedback (free spinning). Often USB devices are involved, that are originaly intended e.g., for video cutting on a desktop PCs. For the automobile domain these are not suited, due to the missing haptic feedback.

Here you find a low price way, to enable the development of own mock-up in-vehicle interfaces for experiments, that can be controlled with a suited rotary knob.
